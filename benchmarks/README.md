# MAKESPEARE/benchmarks

This has the newly-created input/output data for the benchmarks used in the MAKESPEARE AAAI paper, in the format required by MAKESPEARE.  These are gzip-compressed files.  Uncompress them before using them.

Note this doesn't include the 7 Established Benchmarks for which input/output data was previously available; for those see the conversion script in MAKESPEARE/scripts.  

This also doesn't include the TIS-100 benchmarks; see the main MAKESPEARE/README.md for the required format for those.
